      					<h5>Safe Hiking with Your Dog (in Hawaii)</h5><p class="author">By Wendi Lau</p>
						<p>
							Being in nature is important to the physical and spiritual health of people and dogs. We are fortunate that Hawaii offers a plethora of accessible trails ranging in fauna, steepness, and terrain (valley, ridge, or shoreline). Going for a hike or run creates a tired, happy, and better-behaved dog. He enjoys the challenge of rocks, branches, and streams. Trails are natural agility courses!
							Always research the trail and look at videos for shade and difficulty. The Hikers Guide to O’ahu updated and expanded edition by Stuart M. Ball, Jr. (2013) is an excellent resource containing trail directions, descriptions, and topographic maps. The amount of water you and your dog carry should determine the length of your hike. Turn around BEFORE half of the water is gone and hydrate the dog at least every 30 minutes. Ball recommends at least one liter of water per person for short, easy hikes (Ball, 2013, p. xviii), so bring extra on top of that for your dog.
							Keep a watchful eye on the dog’s behavior and comfort. Cesar Milan writes “If their tongue is hanging out of their mouth more than halfway, it’s a sign to stop and take a rest…If they start picking up their paws too quickly, it may be a sign that the ground is too hot, so find some shade to cool off.” <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/cesar-millan/hiking-with-your-dog_b_6655446.html">(Cesar Milan's Hiking with Your Dog)</a>
							<br>
							<br>
							<strong>Other important safety considerations for hiking with your dog:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Keep the dog on a leash as curious dogs that run off can get lost or attacked by hunting dogs.</li>
							<li>If you see a hunter’s truck near the trailhead (usually has a cage over the truck bed) maybe choose another trail or day to hike. The mountains aren’t going anywhere. Most hunters have tight control over their dogs, which are required to be leashed unless in active pursuit of prey. However, hunting dogs are behaving as pack animals in nature and your pet dog may just be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Use caution. Be safe.</li>
							<li>Hike by TIME NOT DISTANCE. Start with 30-45 minutes in then turn around and go back. Do not push on if you or the dog is new to hiking or the trail.</li>
							<li>Be aware of sunset and give yourself plenty of time. Valley and ridge hikes get darker sooner than the official sunset time.</li>
							<li>Be calm. If you are nervous or unsure your dog will feel it and may become aggressive to other hikers and dogs to protect you.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<strong>Good, shady trails for dogs and people:</strong>
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Waimano Stream trail</li>
							<li>Manana Falls trail</li>
							<li>Aiea Loop trail</li>
							<li>Tantalus trails starting from Hawaii Nature Center or Pu’u ‘Ualaka’a Park</li>
							<li>Kuli’ou’ou Ridge trail</li>
							<li>Maunawilili trail</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							There are others. These are just the trails I am most familiar with. Most importantly, take it easy, bring lots of water, have fun. Several short and enjoyable hikes are better than one long, disastrous one. You and your dog deserve the gift of trails Hawaii offers.

        				<h5>A Dog with a Yard Still Needs a Walk</h5><p class="author">By Wendi Lau</p>
      					<p>
							All dogs require at least 45 minutes of exercise twice a day in the form of a brisk walk or run	with their owners. A high-energy dog like my pitbull mix needs at least one hour. This walk is important to create and strengthen the master-dog bond and work off excess energy that can cause misbehaviors. I can tell exactly when Nori, 1-1/2 years old, is overdue for her walk because she begins to get naughty: chewing on things and pulling up plants. 
							<br>
							<br>
							A tired dog is a happy, calm, fulfilled dog that has used its body and brain. Once a week my husband and I take Nori on a two hour hike or a one hour trail run. She sniffs pig trails and mongoose poop, jumps over culverts and rocks, and splashes in the stream. When we are done she is a little dirty, but very happy and pooped from all the stimulation and exercise. Animals spend a lot of time looking for food and travelling with their pack. Since humans have become the pack of domestic dogs, they like to travel with us.
							<br>
							<br>
							Why isn’t playing in the yard enough exercise? The dog can run around in a yard, but it is not following directions like sit or stay, or walking on a lead besides its owner. Both involve listening to and obeying the owner while the owner practices being in charge and leading. These walks create movement with a shared purpose, which is essential for a strong dog-pack leader bond, according to Cesar Millan. The dog is content when it knows its place in the pack and obeys the owner/leader. Unlike people, dogs do not need to feel special, independent, or unique. Dog psychology is different from that of people. Even with yard space, toys, and playmates, all dogs need to be walked twice a day. Not surprisingly, people probably do too!
